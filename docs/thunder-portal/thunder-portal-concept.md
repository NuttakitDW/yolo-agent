# Thunder Portal: Cross-Chain Atomic Swaps for 1inch Fusion+

## Executive Summary

Thunder Portal extends 1inch Fusion+ to enable trustless, atomic swaps between Ethereum and Bitcoin networks. By implementing a custom resolver coupled with a Bitcoin HTLC API service, Thunder Portal brings non-EVM chains into the Fusion+ ecosystem while maintaining complete decentralization and security.

## Problem Statement

Currently, 1inch Fusion+ excels at cross-chain swaps between EVM-compatible chains. However, users wanting to swap between Ethereum and Bitcoin face significant challenges:

- **Centralized Bridges**: Most solutions require trusting intermediaries
- **Wrapped Tokens**: Not actual Bitcoin, introduces counterparty risk
- **Complex UX**: Multiple steps across different platforms
- **Security Risks**: Bridge hacks have resulted in billions in losses

## Solution: Thunder Portal

Thunder Portal solves these challenges by implementing atomic swaps - cryptographically guaranteed exchanges that either complete fully or fail safely, with no possibility of partial execution or fund loss.

### Key Innovation

We introduce a two-layer architecture:

1. **Bitcoin HTLC as a Service API**: Handles all Bitcoin-specific complexity
2. **Custom Fusion+ Resolver**: Bridges 1inch orders with Bitcoin operations

This separation allows us to integrate Bitcoin's UTXO model with Fusion+'s intent-based system seamlessly.

## How It Works

### Swap Flow: ETH → BTC

```
1. User Creation
   └─> User initiates swap on 1inch interface
   └─> Specifies ETH amount and BTC destination

2. Order Broadcasting
   └─> Fusion+ broadcasts order to resolvers
   └─> Thunder Portal resolver detects BTC order

3. Atomic Setup
   └─> Resolver creates Bitcoin HTLC via API
   └─> Same hash used on both chains
   └─> Resolver funds Bitcoin side

4. Execution
   └─> Resolver fills Fusion+ order (ETH locked)
   └─> User reveals preimage to claim BTC
   └─> Resolver uses preimage to claim ETH

5. Completion
   └─> Both swaps succeed atomically
   └─> Or both timeout and refund
```

### Swap Flow: BTC → ETH

The process works in reverse, with users locking BTC first and receiving ETH upon preimage reveal.

## Technical Architecture

### Components

┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│   User Wallet   │     │  Thunder Portal  │     │   Bitcoin       │

    [1inch Fusion+]         [Coordination]            [Bitcoin Network]
```

### Bitcoin HTLC Script

```
HASH160 <payment_hash> EQUAL
IF
    <user_pubkey>                    // User can claim with preimage
ELSE
    <timeout> CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY DROP
    <resolver_pubkey>                // Resolver can refund after timeout
ENDIF
CHECKSIG
```

### Security Model

1. **Atomic Execution**: Same hash on both chains ensures all-or-nothing
2. **Timeout Protection**: Funds return automatically if swap fails
3. **No Custody**: Users and resolvers control their own keys
4. **Permissionless**: Anyone can run a resolver

## Competitive Advantages

### vs Centralized Exchanges
- **Non-custodial**: No counterparty risk
- **Permissionless**: No KYC for swaps
- **Transparent**: All operations on-chain

### vs Existing Bridges
- **No wrapped tokens**: Real BTC, not IOUs
- **No bridge risk**: Can't be hacked like traditional bridges
- **Truly atomic**: Mathematical guarantees, not trust

### vs Other Atomic Swap Solutions
- **Better UX**: Integrated into 1inch interface
- **Professional liquidity**: Resolver competition ensures good rates
- **Gas abstraction**: Resolvers handle Bitcoin fees

## Use Cases

1. **DeFi Traders**: Move between Ethereum DeFi and Bitcoin
2. **Arbitrageurs**: Exploit price differences across chains
3. **Privacy Users**: Exit to Bitcoin for enhanced privacy
4. **Long-term Holders**: Convert profits to BTC for storage

## Market Opportunity
