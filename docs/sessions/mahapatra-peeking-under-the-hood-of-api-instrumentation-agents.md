# Peeking under the hood of API instrumentation agents

**Speakers:** Amitosh Mahapatra

**Language:** English

**Category:** System Administration or DevOps

## Abstract

Modern software observability relies on instrumentation agents for collecting telemetry data with minimal code changes to provide insights into system behavior, performance, and reliability. These agents, such as those used by OpenTelemetry, work seamlessly to collect telemetry data, but what happens under the hood? In this talk, we will explore the techniques behind these tools, unveiling how they achieve their magic. This talk will dissect the key mechanisms used by instrumentation agents, including monkey patching to modify library behaviors at runtime, dynamic injection of logs, counters, spans, and traces, and strategic interception of method calls and hacking Python imports to transparently wrap or augment code execution, allowing for unobtrusive monitoring.
