# Open Standards and Lakehouse AI Development - Arrow Flight, Apache Iceberg, and MCP

**Speakers:** Alex Merced

**Session Type:** 30-mins talk session

**Level:** Beginner

**Language:** English

**Category:** Machine Learning or AI

## Abstract

As AI development shifts toward more agentic and composable workloads, the modern data lakehouse must rise to meet new demands — performance, interoperability, and intelligent access to resources. We’ll focus on three key technologies: - Arrow Flight – A high-performance data transfer protocol that enables low-latency, columnar data sharing between engines, perfect for real-time AI pipelines. - Apache Iceberg REST Catalog Spec – A critical standard that allows diverse tools and systems to communicate seamlessly with Iceberg catalogs, enabling broader compatibility and easier integration. - Model Context Protocol (MCP) – A new standard that empowers AI agents to discover and leverage available tools, datasets, and prompts in a structured, contextual way. Together, these standards form the backbone of an open and flexible lakehouse ecosystem — enabling fast data movement, cross-system compatibility, and intelligent AI-agent orchestration.
