## Abstract

For many years, pandas has been the de facto standard for data transformation and analysis in Python. While pandas is still the main tool most people use, Polars has emerged as the main challenger to pandas, bringing incredible speed and more readable code to Python data frame. In this workshop I will give a hands-on introduction to Polars, working step by step with real data. Attendees are expected to be familiar with Python, but it's not important if they used pandas or other data analysis tools before.
