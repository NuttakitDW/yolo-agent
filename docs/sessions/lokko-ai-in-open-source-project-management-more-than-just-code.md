# AI in Open-source Project Management: More than Just Code

**Speakers:** Joyce Dzifa Lokko

**Session Type:** 30-mins talk session

**Level:** Intermediate

**Language:** English

**Category:** Machine Learning or AI

## Abstract

Open source isn't just about code, it's about people, process, and purpose. As communities grow and projects scale, maintaining momentum and clarity becomes increasingly challenging. In this talk, we'll explore how artificial intelligence can support open-source project management beyond automation: From predicting blockers and prioritizing issues to enhancing collaboration and reducing burnout. I’ll demonstrate how AI tools like, Codex Automator for generating custom workflows, Issue Label Bot for intelligent issue tagging, Sourcery for automated code reviews, Remotion.dev for async updates, and Athenian or LinearB for engineering metrics, can be embedded into open-source workflows to automate repetitive tasks, improve team visibility, and make data-informed decisions. Drawing on real-world examples from Python-based communities, I’ll show how these tools can help optimize engagement, streamline collaboration, and ensure contributor well-being all while keeping the human side of open source at the center. The talk will cover the following topics: 1. The human side of open source 2. Beyond code: Planning, communication, and coordination challenges 3. Why AI? Why Now? 4. The growing complexity of community-led projects 5. AI tools you might not know (but should); A few examples of such tools are: Codex Automator, Issue Label Bot, Sourcery, Remotion.dev, Athenian, and LinearB 6. Real-world examples & use cases (Python community project insights) 7. Key takeaways
