**Session Type:** 30-mins talk session

**Level:** Intermediate

**Language:** English

**Category:** Embedding and Extending Python

## Abstract

Python and WebAssembly haven’t exactly been easy to go. While the JS world is deep into WASM, Python's journey into this space is still evolving, with Pyodide, RustPython, CPython experiments, py2wasm, and various runtimes doing different things. In this talk, we’ll explore the current state of Python in the WebAssembly ecosystem: What works, what doesn’t, and what’s missing. We'll also share about work on Waspy, a lightweight open-source Python-to-WASM compiler. The idea is to make Python more portable, embeddable, and WASM-native for modern app environments. 1. Why Python and WASM? – Use-cases, pain-points, potential 2. Brief overview of Python compilation 3. Current Python + WASM ecosystem – Pyodide, RustPython, and py2wasm 4. Designing Waspy and Demo 5. The road ahead – Interop, sandboxed apps, edge use-cases 6. Closing and Q&A
