# Build Modern CI Pipelines in Python

**Speakers:** Vikram Vaswani

**Session Type:** 90-mins workshop session

**Level:** Intermediate

**Language:** English

**Category:** Testing and Development Tool Chains

## Abstract

CI is no longer a simple chain of shell commands. In modern, polyglot organizations, CI workflows must be modular, reusable, and capable of interoperating across multiple languages and teams. Yet many teams still default to YAML or brittle bash scripts, especially in Python projects. What if you could ditch the YAML and write your pipelines in pure, testable, idiomatic Python? This hands-on workshop will explore how to build modular, language-agnostic CI pipelines in Python using Dagger, an open-source runtime created by the founders of Docker that treats pipelines as code. Youâ€™ll learn how to: - Build CI pipelines using Python (no more YAML!) - Reuse logic across teams and projects with Dagger modules - Seamlessly integrate Go, TypeScript, and other languages into Python pipelines Whether you're writing CI for your next Flask app or scaling a CI platform for a large engineering org, Dagger can unlock a smoother CI experience.
