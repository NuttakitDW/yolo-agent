**Speakers:** Stanislav Liashkov

**Session Type:** 30-mins talk session

**Level:** Intermediate

**Language:** English

**Category:** Social Impact

## Abstract

This talk explores key statistical techniques for spatial data analysis in Python, using traffic collision patterns as a concrete example. We’ll begin with data preparation and visualization in GeoPandas to transform raw collision records into informative maps. You’ll then apply kernel density estimation for smooth hotspot heatmaps and global/local Moran’s I for detecting spatial autocorrelation. Next, we’ll introduce Empirical Bayes rate smoothing to stabilize estimates in sparse areas and Local Indicators of Spatial Association to classify risk clusters. Throughout, we’ll leverage PySAL’s spatial-statistics functions and intuition behind them. By distilling these methods into a reusable “recipe,” you’ll gain practical workflows for any spatial analysis project. Armed with these tools, you’ll be ready to turn geospatial data into actionable insights for any geospatial problem During this talk, I will refer to my research project at university (not published yet) as example - <a href="https://github.com/stanislavlia/collisions_hotspots_analysis_montgomery/blob/main/artifacts/Identifying%20High-risk%20areas%20for%20traffic%20collisions%20in%20Montgomery.pdf" target="_blank">https://github.com/stanislavlia/collisions_hotspots_analysis_montgomery/blob/main/artifacts/Identifying%20High-risk%20areas%20for%20traffic%20collisions%20in%20Montgomery.pdf</a>
