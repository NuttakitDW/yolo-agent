## Abstract

Recommendation systems are the heart and soul of many applications, making it possible for us to have personalized experiences in just about every industry. In this session, we're going to take a deep dive into the key parts of a modern recommendation system and discuss on how to build one from the ground up. We'll explore the essential algorithms for data analysis, talk about strategies for dealing with the cold-start problem, and share the best tips for designing a scalable architecture with PostgreSQL and Python. And finally, we'll cover strategies to efficiently scale the system in a high-load environment. Attendees walk away with practical insights into designing, implementing, and scaling recommendation systems, bridging the gap between AI-driven intelligence and real-world applications.
