# Boosting Operational Productivity with Python and Textual: Modern Terminal Dashboards for Developers

**Speakers:** Piti Champeethong

**Session Type:** 30-mins talk session

**Level:** Intermediate

**Language:** English

**Category:** App Development or Developer Productivity

## Abstract

Many developers work primarily in the terminal yet rely on clunky scripts or web dashboards for operational tasks. This talk introduces Textual, a modern Python framework for building interactive, async-first terminal user interfaces (TUIs) that feel like modern apps inside your terminal. We'll walk through a real-world case: a MongoDB cluster admin dashboard built with Textual and then expand into reusable patterns for CI/CD, monitoring, and internal tools. Whether you're an SRE, backend engineer, or DevOps-minded developer, youâ€™ll learn how to architect, package, and scale terminal dashboards that save time, reduce errors, and fit seamlessly into real developer workflows, no GUI or browser required.
