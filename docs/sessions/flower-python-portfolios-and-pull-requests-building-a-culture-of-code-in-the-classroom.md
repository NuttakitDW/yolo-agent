## Abstract

Python isn’t just a great first language—it’s a powerful one. In my high school classroom, we teach it like the real thing. No drag-and-drop, no sandboxes—just Python, GitHub, and the workflows developers actually use. In this talk, I’ll share how I built a classroom culture around Python and professional development practices. Students write real Python projects, manage their work in GitHub repos, submit via pull requests, and get feedback from automated CI workflows powered by pytest, flake8, and GitHub Actions. They build public-facing portfolios, collaborate in teams, and even integrate tools like CodeQL to learn secure-by-default thinking from day one. But this isn’t just about the tooling. It’s about trust, autonomy, and helping students see themselves as developers—not someday, but now. Whether they go straight to industry, on to university, or just get curious about how the internet works, they leave with real habits and real code they’re proud to share. We’ll walk through the core technical setup, how we scaffold collaboration, and how we help students build confidence with the command line, Git, and documentation. You’ll walk away with ideas for building your own internal dev culture—whether you're onboarding junior engineers, mentoring open-source contributors, or helping students thrive in their first real projects. Spoiler: Python is the easy part. Culture is the deep dive.
