# AI Driven Automation in Open-Source Metadata Platforms: Embedding an MCP Server

**Speakers:** Nick Acosta

**Session Type:** 90-mins workshop session

**Level:** Beginner

**Language:** English

**Category:** Machine Learning or AI

## Abstract

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol for AI agent communication that is revolutionizing how AI agents interact with data, and its possibilities for automation and intelligent management erupt when metadata is included. OpenMetadata is an open-source platform that centralizes metadata to empower teams to build and manage high-quality data assets through data discovery, observability, and governance. By combining the two, organizations can automate Python generation that will transform their data operations, realize new ways of efficiency, and unlock the full potential of their data assets. Join us in this hand-on workshop as we: - Introduce both OpenMetadata and MCP servers and their impact on a data stack - Explain architecture motivations for embedding MCP into an OpenMetadata platform instead of using it as a standalone server - Walkthrough transformational use cases for AI to use metadata to proactively identify and fix data quality issues or enforce access and ownership policies - Discuss implications of enabling metadata access to AI agents and the ability to unlock self-service data discovery, usability, and knowledge sharing across an organization By the end of this workshop, data scientists will have: - An increased understanding of metadata and its impact on organization's data architecture - An improved awareness on the operational efficiencies and process improvements centralizing metadata can provide - The ability to move beyond reactive data management with agentic data management automations - A knowledge of a standardized and open way connecting data and metadata systems with LLMs through Model Context Protocol - An open and centralized metadata platform, an LLM platform, and an MCP server connecting the two all on their laptops
