## Abstract

Python makes it easy to start building — but deploying, scaling, and managing that code in production is where the complexity starts. This talk dives into the platform engineering side of Python development: How we built a developer platform to streamline everything from local development to multi-cloud deployment, without overwhelming developers with infrastructure concerns. We’ll share real lessons from building a platform tailored for Python teams, covering: * How developers can build and test locally but deploy to secure, multi-cloud environments * Designing opinionated GitOps workflows, CI/CD, and clear environment boundaries * How platform features like auto-generated architecture diagrams and built-in observability support modern microservice development * Why developer experience is the core of good platform engineering This isn’t a product pitch — it’s a practical look at platform engineering in action, told through the lens of real teams building real services in Python.
