## Abstract

Do you have a voice inside your head that pops up and tells you that you aren't good enough, that your colleague should speak at that event or get that award, or take that secondment rather than you? That voice is not your friend! It is holding you back from opportunity. In this session, I will walk through the 5 types of imposter syndrome and show you how GitHub Copilot can help to silence that voice and overcome your fears. I will show you how it can be a coach, a pair-programmer, an alternate point of view (but not an unfriendly one) and how it can help to reassure the anxious part of you that thinks you are unworthy. I'll also show off my favorite features that I find make me a better coder, tester, more secure collaborator and less annoying teammate. * Please note: GitHub Copilot is an AI assistant, and its responses should not replace professional advice. Always consult with a qualified professional for medical, legal, financial, or other professional matters.
