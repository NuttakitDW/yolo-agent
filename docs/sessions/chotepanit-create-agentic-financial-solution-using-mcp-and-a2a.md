## Abstract

In PyCon 2023, I talked about implementing systematic trading using Python and machine learning. It had been running well until after the US election. The world, or even Thailand, is facing unseen scenarios. The current strategies do not seem to apply to his hardship. By the way, MCP is introduced as a tool that can plug into LLM agents and allow the agents to access fresh information beyond simply RAG. So, I gained the idea to integrate LLM agents and MCP into my trading strategy. My topic covers: - Recap PyCon 2023 (What is the current state of my system) - Pain point and a new promising solution - Introduce MCP and AI agents for stock analysis - Integration into the trading system
