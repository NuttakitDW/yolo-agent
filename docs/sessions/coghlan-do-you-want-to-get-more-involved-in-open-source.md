## Abstract

The free and open-source software community is an astonishing global feat of human collaboration, independently of the software that it creates. Taking a more active role in this community offers significant potential benefits, but also plenty of opportunities for frustration and disappointment. Sparing some time for personal reflection on the question posed in this talk can go a long way towards making our community interactions a positive experience for all involved.
