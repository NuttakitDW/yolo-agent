# PydanticAI Demystified: Building Smarter Generative AI Systems

**Speakers:** Nitin Rathee

**Session Type:** 30-mins talk session

**Level:** Intermediate

**Language:** English

**Category:** Machine Learning or AI

## Abstract

As generative AI becomes increasingly integrated into production systems, ensuring reliability and transparency has never been more important. This session focuses on how developers can build observable generative AI applications by combining the strengths of PydanticAI and Logfire. We’ll begin by exploring how PydanticAI enables the creation of structured agents that bring consistency, validation, and error handling into AI workflows. These agents form the foundation for more testable and maintainable applications. From there, we’ll move into the observability layer with Logfire, showcasing how it uses MCP servers to ingest and surface detailed real-time telemetry - helping teams monitor, debug, and optimize performance proactively. We'll walk through common pain points like inconsistent outputs, silent failures, or lack of visibility in agent pipelines, and demonstrate how this toolset addresses each challenge effectively. Through hands-on examples and live configuration demos, you'll see how structured outputs combined with live metrics and logs lead to better traceability and faster incident resolution. Additionally, we’ll cover best practices for evaluating generative models using deterministic prompts, schema validation, and fine-grained alerting. By the end of this session, attendees will have a deeper understanding of building AI systems that not only perform well but can also be confidently operated and maintained in real-world environments.
