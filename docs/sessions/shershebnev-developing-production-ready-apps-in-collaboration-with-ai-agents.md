## Abstract

AI agents are the next big thing everyone is talking about. They are expected to revolutionize various industries by automating routine tasks, mission critical business workflows, enhancing productivity, and enabling humans to focus on creative and strategic work. Of course, you can apply them to your everyday coding tasks as well. But just like with any other AI or non-AI-based tool, you need to understand how to use it correctly in order to maximize your benefits. In this workshop, you'll get to experience AI coding agents first-hand as we collaborate with them in real time to build a production-ready app from scratch. For that, we will use Zencoder, an AI coding agent platform that empowers developers to ship products faster. We will be building the app in Python, and ideally, you already have some programming experience in Python to get the most out of the session. You will also need to bring your laptop with either VS Code or JetBrains (PyCharm) installed.
